## Note on AI

I’m generally fine with AI being used to _aid_ development, but I’m not able to review non-trivial contributions
that are fully AI-generated or contain no significant human input. These days, my time for working on Lofty
is limited, and I cannot dedicate the time I do have to reviewing AI-generated code or acting as a proxy
for an LLM in my reviews.
