/// use lofty::prelude::*;
///
/// // Read the tag from a file
/// # fn main() -> lofty::error::Result<()> {

/// let mut id3v2 = mpeg_file
/// 	.id3v2_mut()
/// 	.map(std::mem::take)
/// 	.unwrap_or_default();
///
/// // Split: ID3v2 -> [`lofty::Tag`]
/// let (mut remainder, mut tag) = id3v2.split_tag();
///
/// // Modify the metadata in the generic [`lofty::Tag`], independent
/// // of the underlying tag and file format.
/// tag.insert_text(ItemKey::TrackTitle, "Track Title".to_owned());

/// // ID3v2 <- [`lofty::Tag`]
/// let id3v2 = remainder.merge_tag(tag);

/// // Write the changes back into the file
/// mpeg_file.set_id3v2(id3v2);
